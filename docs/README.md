# Liquido Payment Provider Framework (IO)

## VTEX Disclaimer

This is a feature in BETA stage, which means it's on a testing phase. In case there is a new scenario that PPF is not ready, VTEX team will take some time to perform an investigation. If it's a case that need the development of anything new, this will enter the process of prioritization of the product team. This can take some time, so VTEX don't recommend the use of this Beta version of PPF for connectors related to stores with rollout date close (less than 3 months).
